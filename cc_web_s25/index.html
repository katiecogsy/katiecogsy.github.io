   Katie Coughlan's Creative Coding Portfolio!

    <p>
     I use coding to bring creative ideas to life, blending tech with art to create unique digital experiences. 
    <p>
     My work explores how light, color, and motion can come together in new and exciting ways.
    <p> 
     Through interactive design, I aim to spark emotions and make people think differently about the digital world around them.
